function markPredictiveStates ()
% The calculates the predictive state for each cell. A cell will turn on its predictive state
% output if one of its segments becomes active, i.e. if enough of its lateral inputs are currently active due
% to feed-forward input. In this case, the cell queues up the following changes: reinforcement of the
% currently active segment.
%
% This function computes the indices of the cells in predicted state and stores it in the sparse array 
% SM.cellPredicted. In the process of computing this, it stores the count of active synapses for the dendrites 
% feeding from the currently  active cells. It keeps two kinds of counts — count of active synapses in 
% SM.dendriteActive and count of positive synapses in SM.dendritePositive.
% We also compute the list of dendrites that are active based on learnStates in SM.dendriteLearn
