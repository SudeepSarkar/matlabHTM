function markLearnStates ()
% Update the learn states of the cells (one per ACTIVE columns). This is to be run after the active states
% have been updated (compute_active_states). For those ACTIVE COLUMNS, this code further selects ONE cell
% per column as the learning cell (learnState). The logic is as follows. If an active cell has a segment that
% became active from cells chosen with learnState on, this cell is selected as the learning cell, i.e. learnState is
% set to 1.

% For bursting columns, the best matching cell is chosen as the learning cell and a new segment is added to that
% cell. Note that it is possible that there is no best matching cell; in this case getBestMatchingCell chooses
% a cell with the fewest number of segments, using a random tiebreaker

% getBestMatchingCell - For the given column, return the cell with the best matching segment (as defined below).
% If no cell has a matching segment, then return a cell with the fewest number of segments using a
% random tiebreaker.

% Best matching segment - For the given column c cell i, find the segment with the largest number of ACTIVE
% synapses. This routine is aggressive in finding the best match. The permanence value of
% synapses is ALLOWED to be below connectedPerm. The number of active synapses is allowed to
% be below activationThreshold, but must be above minThreshold. The routine returns the
% segment index. If no segments are found, then an index of -1 is returned.
